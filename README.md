This is a simple browser extension that allows you to bypass paywalls using 12ft proxy. This works by loading a cached version of the page from Google, since websites doesn't show a paywall to any crawler. The extension is available for both Chrome and Firefox.

## Installation

Since I didn't wanted to pay to upload it to any browser extension store, you'll need to install it manually.

### Chrome

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to the Extensions page by clicking on the three dots in the top right corner of the window, selecting "More tools", and then "Extensions".
3. Enable developer mode by toggling the switch in the top right corner of the page.
4. Click on the "Load unpacked" button in the top left corner of the page.
5. Select the directory where your extension's files are located, and click "Select".
6. Your extension should now be installed and visible in the Extensions page.

### Firefox

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Firefox and navigate to the Add-ons Manager by clicking on the three horizontal lines in the top right corner of the window and selecting "Add-ons".
3. Click on the gear icon in the top right corner of the page and select "Debug Add-ons".
4. Click on the "Load Temporary Add-on" button in the top left corner of the page.
5. Select the `manifest.json` file in your extension's directory and click "Open".
6. Your extension should now be installed and visible in the Add-ons Manager.

Note that in Firefox, the extension will only be installed temporarily and will be removed when you close the browser. To install the extension permanently, you will need to sign it and distribute it through the Firefox Add-ons Marketplace.

## How to use

Once you have installed the extension, simply navigate to the website that has a paywall and click on the extension's icon in the top right corner of your browser window.
